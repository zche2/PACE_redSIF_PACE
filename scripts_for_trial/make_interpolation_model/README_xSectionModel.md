### Make cross section model out of gridded pressure and temperature
The most up-to-date script should be `Automate_MakeModel.jl`

Save the model in jld2 files, see directory: `/home/zhe2/data/MyProjects/PACE_redSIF_PACE/interp_xSection`

with meta data of temperature, pressure, and wavenumber grids used

Should have a .log file documenting the configuration

if not, don't trust and use it in successional analysis :\

p.s., something has messed up, .log files in this folder should not be distribute to the data folder!
