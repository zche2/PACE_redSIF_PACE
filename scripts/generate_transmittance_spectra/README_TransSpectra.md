### Generate transmittance spectra using reanalysis layered profiles
The most up-to-date script should be `Generate_transmittance`, which allows generation of transmittance down to designated layers (default: randomly selected).  

We write a script to directly simulate two-way transmittance, assuming sunlight is reflected to the space according to a known distribution. The name of the script should be `Generate_TwoWay_Transmittance`.

Interpolation model, atmospheric profiles, bands, and other metadata are included in the output nc file.
